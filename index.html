        // console.log("Hello World") - worked as expected

        // ** Initial Comments **

        // * Computer's Choice *
        // Create a function named getComputerChoice.
        // Write the function so that it returns "rock", "paper" or "scissors". Math.random likely to be a good choice for selecting between the three options.
        // Test that the function works as expected using console logs or developer tools.

        // Create function getComputerChoice - watch out with the typing of it!
        function getComputerChoice() {
            // Use Math.random to assign a random number between 0 and 1 to a new variable
            const randomNumber = Math.random();
            // console.log(randomNumber)
            // if variable is less than 0.333, return "rock"
            // else if between 0.333 and 0.666, return "paper"
            // else return "scissors"
            if (randomNumber < 0.333) {
                return "rock"
            } else if (randomNumber >= 0.333 && randomNumber < 0.666) {
                return "paper"
            } else {
                return "scissors"
            }
        }

        // * The Human Choice *
        // Create a function named getHumanChoice.
        // Write the function so that it will return one of the three valid choices.
        // Use prompt method to get their input, restricted to just "rock", "paper" or "scissors".
        // Maybe worth encouraging the user to press "R", "P" or "S" and then converting the input to the proper strings after the fact.
        // Again test using the tools available.



        // * Declare the players' score variables *
        // Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
        // Initialise them with a value of 0 (integer).



        // * Write the game logic for a single round *
        // Create function named playRound.
        // Define two parameters (humanChoice, computerChoice) for this function.
        // humanChoice parameter needs to be case-insensitive, so it doesn't matter how the word was input by the user.
        // Write code so that playRound logs a message to the console indicating the winner. Example given is "You lose! Paper beats rock".
        // Increment humanScore or computerScore variable depending on the round winner in each case.



        // * Write the logic to play the entire game *
        // Each game lasts 5 rounds.
        // Create function playGame.
        // Move playRound function and scoring variables so that they are declared within the new playGame function.
        // Call playRound 5 times, using a while loop perhaps? Initialise at 1 and then use remainder % 5 to quit after 5th round.
        // Make sure to call choice functions each round, not the variables they produced initially, otherwise values of the variables won't update with new choices.
        // Be open to re-writing my functions at this stage, or adding new helper functions.
