My attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors project in The Odin Project.

Step 1 - Initialise

I've initialised the git repo and created two starting files, this readme and the index file with a script tag directly within it.


Step 2 - Understanding and then planning the project

I've added comments about the project into my index file, just so I don't need to switch windows so often and also to make sure I do understand what the instructions are asking for.

I'm then going to split the work up into the 5 sections suggested, computer's choice, human's choice, score variables, playing a single round, playing the entire game.

It does seem relatively simple, but I'll still make a point of adding the pseudocode first each time to try and build the habit at this early stage.
